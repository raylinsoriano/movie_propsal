# Business Problem

Microsoft is starting there own movie studio. They need a guide on what types of movie they should be producing first to get the best return on investment. So, hopefully overtime the studio can expand and get bigger to create more films.

# Data
-IMBD

-The Numbers
  
# Methods
I will be comparing the return on invest (ROI) as my metric and compare genres, release date, and runtime with their return in investment. I will be using built-in libraries like pandas and matplotlib to create my graphs.

# Results
This shows that the Horror, Mystery, Thriller is the genre to invest in.

The best months to release your film are January and July.

# Conclusion
The three recommendations that I would give to Microsoft are: 
- The best genre to start off with is Horror, Mystery, Thriller since it gives the best return on investment
- The months of the year to release ther films are in January and July
- Movies that have the greatest return on investment have a runtime of 106 minutes (approx. 2 hours)

# Next Steps
Start looking at other factors that might generate a higher return of investment for the films, like having a popular actor or anazlying what is a good budget for a movie to invest in.
